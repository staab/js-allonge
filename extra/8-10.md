### Discussion questions

- How can explicitly binding an instance to all the methods of the same instance on creation (e.g., using _.bindAll) cause problems with prototypal inheritance?
- What is the difference between currying and partial application?
- What is the difference between instance, object, and constructor methods?
- Why is [YouAreDaChef](https://github.com/raganwald/YouAreDaChef#you-are-da-chef), (written by Raganwald himself) bad?
- What is the difference between assigning to `this` in a constructor and adding stuff to the prototype after class definition?

### Exercises

This week I've included some tests at the bottom of the page, for each exercise.

1. Write a constructor for a Car
    - It should have the following methods, shared between instances:
        - `accelerate`
        - `decelerate`
    - Make sure initial state of on/off and speed are set in the constructor so that they are not shared between instances
    - Make accelerate depend on a `getMaxSpeed` method, added to each object, not to the instance.
    - Don't worry about encapsulation for now - all the properties can be public. Just don't use them publicly
2. Inherit from your Car model to create a Truck model with a `bedCapacity` property, and `fillBed` and `removeFromBed` methods that take a value.
3. Mix into the Truck model a `ManualTransmission` mixin with methods `getRpm`, `setGear`
4. Let's do some dynamic prototypal inheritance - after you define Car and Truck, the government secretly installes kill switch backdoors into all your vehicles! Add to your Car prototype a `killAll` method that prevents any car or truck from running. On a particular object, override the method so you're safe from the government.
5. Using compose/pipeline, write a pipe that takes a value and, in order, adds 3, multiplies by 5, and subtracts 6.
6. Write a pipe object that does its operations in order on the passed value. Let the user of the object inject functions anywhere in the pipeline using `insert`. Use a function for the base object rather than an object, so that you can just call the pipe with a value to run it. [hint](http://stackoverflow.com/a/17111430)
7. Use each of the following underscore methods in the exercises. If you can't integrate them into an exercise, just make something up so you know your tools.
    - each
    - map
    - reduce
    - reduceRight
    - find
    - filter
    - where
    - findWhere
    - reject
    - every
    - some
    - contains
    - invoke
    - pluck
    - max
    - min
    - sortBy
    - groupBy
    - indexBy
    - countBy
    - shuffle
    - sample
    - toArray
    - size
    - partition


#### Automated tests

Add these test cases to your code for each example, then run it in node. Include the assert module by `requiring` it. You'll have to change the path to the file.

1.

```
var assert = require("PATH_TO/js-allonge/exercises/assert.js");

var car = new Car();
car.getMaxSpeed = function getMaxSpeed(){
    return 65;
};

car.accelerate(30);
assert(car.speed === 30, "Accelerate succeeded.");
car.accelerate(40);
assert(car.speed === car.getMaxSpeed(), "Max speed applied on excessive acceleration.");
car.decelerate(20);
assert(car.speed === car.getMaxSpeed() - 20, "Decelerate succeeded.");
car.decelerate(car.getMaxSpeed());
assert(car.speed === 0, "Min speed of 0 applied on excessive deceleration.");
```

2.

```
var assert = require("PATH_TO/js-allonge/exercises/assert.js");

var truck = new Truck();
truck.getMaxSpeed = function getMaxSpeed(){
    return 55;
};

truck.accelerate(30);
assert(truck.speed === 30, "Accelerate succeeded.");
truck.accelerate(40);
assert(truck.speed === truck.getMaxSpeed(), "Max speed applied on excessive acceleration.");
truck.decelerate(20);
assert(truck.speed === truck.getMaxSpeed() - 20, "Decelerate succeeded.");
truck.decelerate(truck.getMaxSpeed());
assert(truck.speed === 0, "Min speed of 0 applied on excessive deceleration.");

truck.fillBed(300);
assert(truck.bedFilled === 300, "FillBed succeeded.");
truck.fillBed(400);
assert(truck.bedFilled === truck.bedCapacity, "Max capacity applied on excessive bed filling.");
truck.removeFromBed(200);
assert(truck.bedFilled === truck.bedCapacity - 200, "Remove from bed succeeded.");
truck.removeFromBed(truck.bedCapacity);
assert(truck.bedFilled === 0, "Min capacity of 0 applied on excessive bed removal.");
```

 6. 

```
var assert = require("PATH_TO/js-allonge/exercises/assert.js");

var pipe = new Pipe();
pipe.append(function(v){ return v + 2; });
pipe.append(function(v){ return v * 2; });
pipe.prepend(function(v){ return v - 2; });
pipe.insert(1, function(v){ return v + 10; });

// Actual order:
// ((((value - 2) + 10) + 2) * 2)

assert(pipe(3) === 26, "Piping 3 returned 26.");
assert(pipe(-3) === 14, "Piping -3 returned 14.");
assert(pipe(-20) === -20, "Piping -20 returned 26.");
```
