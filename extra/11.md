### Exercises
1. Invent an [abstract data type](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_data_type) and write an iterator for it.
2. Refactor the iterator constructor to be "new agnostic". Write a mixin and apply it to the original constructor.
3. Create a class decorator which adds a method "sum" to an iterator. Create a class decorator that adds a method "max" to an iterator. Create two new classes using these decorators plus your abstract data type iterator, and find the sum and max of instances of each.
4. Implement a recursive character count function (["ab", ["ab", "bc"]] -> {"a": 2, "b": 3, "c": 1}), and make it tail recursive using thunks and trampolining. Apply it to your iterator.
